## Is Air Quality worse where racial minorities live in the US?

This project attempts to understand and answer if there is a relationship between Air Quality and the population distribution in the United States. This project is a course requirement for the Data Engineering Nanodegree from Udacity. This project covers Data Modeling, Data Wrangling using Apache Spark and analysis using AWS Redshift.

### Data

The data sets used for the project are:
1. Daily Measurements of pollutant gases and particulate matter from 2016-2019. Sourced AQS Datamart by U.S. EPA. Each data set contains 4 files (one per year).
    a. Ozone (row count ~ )
    b. Carbon Monoxide (row count ~ )
    c. Sulphur Dioxide (row count ~ )
